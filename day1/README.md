First! Let's create a ps1 file to put some variables for our deployement deployment script. 
We will name this file var.ps1. This file will follow us in the next few days. 

Day1 objective;

-   Create the variable file
-   Create the az-deploy.ps1 to build our deployment script 
-   Begin to define some variables
-   Create a resource group based on those variables and the script az-deploy.ps1



```yaml
#create variable in  the file var.ps1

```
